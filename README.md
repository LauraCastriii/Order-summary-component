### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I managed to improve the writing of pure css, that is, without the use of libraries that would save me work. At the same time, I reinforced my knowledge when structuring and giving styles to the challenge

Some snippets of code:

```html
<div class="content-title">
  <h2>Order Summary</h2>
</div>
```
```css
.content-title {
	font-size: 16px;
	margin: 50px 0 10px 0;
}
```

### Continued development

I would like to apply vanilla javascript and pure css in future projects
